## Story

It's always a great thing to help others.
Maybe you're already helping out in a dog shelter,
handing out food for people in need, collecting used cloth for charities or
separate garbage to keep our planet clean. All little matters.

In fact, there are many NGOs (non-governmental organizations) specialized for some good cause.
In this project, you'll have the chance to help one of them.

Choose an organisation who you'd like to help with a new website.
Some of them already have great sites, this time, try to find one who lacks a site or has one,
but an old, not so useful one.
They may work in any area.

## What are you going to learn?

- How to plan a landing page.
- How to create a wireframe.
- How to implement a whole website.

## Tasks

1. Choose an NGO, which could use a better website and replan their page in a way that it clearly explains their cause and the working of their organization and convince the visitor that the NGO is legit and trustworthy and it is worth supporting.

   - There is a clear topic for whom the website was created
   - There is an introduction of the NGO in the projects `README.md` file at the top
   - The cause and the workings of the NGO is showcased on the page
   - There is also an `About` and a `Contact` section on the page

2. Like any real life project, an NGOs website should be also planned well.

   - There is a mid-fidelity wireframe created and saved in the repository (as an image)
   - The wireframe was reviewed before any implementation started

3. You have great freedom on this project. Follow the linked articles on how a great landing page looks like and implement what is necessary for your chosen NGO to gain conversion.
   - There is a nice and clean landing page for the selected NGO
   - The page has at least 5 screen height in desktop view

## General requirements

- Use only native HTML and CSS, no 3rd party stuff, nothing else
